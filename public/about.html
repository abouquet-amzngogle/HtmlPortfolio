<br/>
<br/>
I’m a Finance and Information Technology major with an Economics minor at Bryant University, graduating Spring 2026,
 with a strong focus on software development, cloud computing, and data-driven systems. My academic background uniquely 
 blends technical engineering skills with business, finance, and risk analysis—allowing me to build solutions that are both
  scalable and commercially impactful.
<br/><hr/>
I’m currently completing advanced coursework in Infrastructure and Cloud Computing, Data Warehousing in the Age of Big Data, 
Systems Analysis & IT Consulting, and IT Security & Risk Management, alongside upper-level finance and economics courses such as 
Risk Management and Insurance and Labor Economics. This curriculum has strengthened my understanding of distributed systems, cloud architecture,
 data pipelines, security, and enterprise technology strategy.
<br/><hr/>
On the technical side, I am actively developing my software engineering skill set through hands-on projects and certifications.
 I am currently enrolled in The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp (Udemy), where I’m building end-to-end web applications using modern
  front-end and back-end technologies. In parallel, I am pursuing the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification,
   gaining experience with cloud infrastructure, deployment, networking, IAM, and scalable application environments.
I’ve completed and presented multiple applied analytics and technology projects using:
<br/><hr/>
Power BI (interactive dashboards, data modeling, DAX)
<br/>
Tableau (data storytelling and visual analytics)
<br/>
Excel (Power Pivot, PivotTables, PivotCharts, KPI dashboards)
<br/>
Bloomberg Terminal (financial data analysis and market research)
<br/>
TDM Studio (text mining, NLP, and unstructured data analysis)
<br/>
Python (data analysis, visualization, and financial automation)
<br/>
SQL (database querying, data manipulation, and reporting)
<br/>
<hr/>
These projects strengthened my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights while reinforcing core programming,
 system design, and analytical thinking skills.

As I prepare to graduate, I’m highly motivated to secure a Software Developer or Software Engineering role where I can continue building scalable applications, 
cloud-based systems, and data-driven products. I’m especially interested in roles that sit at the intersection of software, cloud infrastructure, analytics, 
and business problem-solving.

I’m always learning, building, refining, and I’m excited to contribute to teams that value clean code, thoughtful system design, and real-world impact.</p>
